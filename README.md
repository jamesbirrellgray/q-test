# Q-test
A cms test project for the Q front-end excersize.

## My solution
With the information supplied about the role and as the excersize includes extra points for GraphQL I've decide to implement the following basic stack and structure:

* Front End
    * React (With SSR, Redux and Relay)
    * GraphQL
* Back End
    * Node/Express
    * Data (json mocks)

I've chosen the above structure to represent a "real world" scenario and separation of concerns e.g. Front End & Back End temas.

I've also chosen to include SSR (Server Side Rendering) as the task is a CMS and therefore I would expect would need good SEO capabilities.
